    <string name="pvinfo1">The following equation is used:</string>
    <string name="pvinfo2">The logic behind this formula is that a dollar today is not worth a dollar tomorrow. For example, if you leave $1000 in the bank for a year, it will be worth more (Future Value). Similarly, when you will receive $1000 a year from now, it is worth less to you now (Present Value).</string>
    <string name="pvinfo3">Present Value: The value of a one-time cash flow today</string>
    <string name="pvinfo4">Future Value: The value of a one-time cash flow in the future</string>
    <string name="pvinfo5">Interest Rate / Discount Rate: The ANNUAL interest at which you want the one-time cash flow to grow / decrease</string>
    <string name="pvinfo6">Number of Periods per year: For interst that compounds (is applied) multiple times a year, it specifies how often in one year an annual interest rate is applied</string>
    <string name="pvinfo7">Number of Years: How long do you wish the one-time cash flow to grow / to diminish</string>
